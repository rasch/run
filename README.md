# run

A shell script, task runner, and alternative to make for use on smaller projects
(that don't have long running builds or tasks).

Download and edit the `run` script to meet the project's requirements.

```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rasch/run/refs/heads/main/run
chmod +x run
./run build
# => build task not implemented
```
